# Who is Julia?

Originally from rural southern Germany, I consider myself a world citizen. I'm based in Berlin since about 10 years and I love the diversity of the big metropolis! 🏦

I worked previously for many year software companies, serving as a link between customers and internal technical teams. This is how my curiosity for diving deeper into technical aspects grew.

I'm currently finalizing my studies in Cybersecurity (B. Eng) at Wismar University. At the same time I'm strengthening my programming skills and trying to combine both. 

In my freetime I like to travel ✈️🚝, read (thriller and non-fictional) 📗 and to be creative ✂️.
